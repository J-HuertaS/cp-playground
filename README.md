# Competitive Programming Repository
This repository contains my solutions to **algorithmic and competitive programming problems**, mainly from HackerRank and Codeforces.
The goal is to **build strong problem-solving skills**, prepare for technical interviews, and maintain a structured archive of solutions across multiple topics.

## Topics Covered
The repository is organized by topic, so similar problems stay together:
```bash
/arrays
/strings
/linked-lists
/trees
/graphs
/dp
/greedy
/math
/bit-manipulation
/searching
/sorting
/geometry
/misc
```
Mixed-topic problems will be placed under /misc or classified by their dominant technique.

## Languages
I use **C++** and **TypeScript** as my main languages,
but I remain open to using others when experimenting or solving platform-specific challenges.

## Platforms
* **HackerRank**
* **Codeforces**

Each solution includes:
- Problem link
- Explanation or key idea (when needed)
- Time and space complexity (for relevant problems)

## Purpose of This Repository
- Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Develop fluency with data structures and performance-oriented solutions
- Track consistent daily/weekly practice
- Demonstrate commitment to learning and improving in algorithmic challenges
